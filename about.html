            Through my internships, I've worn a lot of hats. I've not only worked as someone linking teams together, I have become the designer, the marketer, and the analyst.
            And along the way, I loved communicating with the different teams, generating plans together, and, in the end, celebrating with everyone after making milestones. It is this
            the opportunity to work with different people and different teams that draws me to product management. In my experiences, every day has been different, with
            new challenges and wins, and everyday requires 110% effort to succeed, whuch allows me to constantly challenge myself, meaning everyday I am
            growing and learning.

           <div class="subtitle2"> I think big. When I build something or work on a project, I see the end result being as grand as a castle. Once I have dreamed it,
             I create a blueprint on how I will build it, as building something big cannot happen overnight. For example, in my time at Seneque, I had the idea to create a
             generalized python script which could take a csv as an input and would automate cleaning and running analyses on data, as I noticed this was a bottle-neck. With this vision in mind, I talked things through with my boss,
             to make sure this script would be helpful, and once I got the go-ahead, I took it step by step. I took note
             of the kind of data we normally worked with, what analysis we normally ran, and what kind of results were needed. Once I answered these questions, I moved forward with writing pseudocode
             and writing the script. While I had to adjust my blueprint multiple times through the process, due to new information and bugs with my code, I did build a castle.
             No castle can ever be perfect, and when I finished mine I kept seeing cracks to fix and ways to make it grander. However, even the base version was instrumental in reducing workload of analysis from a 6-7 hour task into 15 minutes.

           </div>

           <div class="subtitle2"> From when I was a child, I have been curious about everything, from wondering why rainbows are formed to why humans behave the way that they do.
            After being in university for 3 years, I have learned to really harness this wild curiosity to create connections that others cannot see. For example, when I see a problem, I
           learn everything about it, so I can truly know what I am facing, view it from all angles, to make sure that I do not pigeonhole myself into a perspective that is not the best, and
           I take the plunge in solving it. Though complex, I love this 3-step system as it challenges me to learn and stretch my mind to see things from different
           angles, some of which can be very unique. It is this train of thought that allows me to build grandly. Once I am done with solving a problem, I jump onto the next, as there is always more to learn.

           </div>

           <div class="subtitle2">I believe that a product that "wins" doesn't necessarily have to be the best product, but must have the correct timing and positioning. It is necessary to seize opportunity
             when the prime time presents itself. My keen eye for these opportunities, and my will to take inititave has led to my successes. For example, when compiling data and analyzing market sentiment
             at Seneque, I noticed an underserved channel that would increase our expected profits body 25% while the cost to serve it would be minimal. My proposal and roadmap were approved by the CEO and
             is set to become one of our key differentiators. This is an example of opportunism because I thought big, was able to transfer my ideals into actionable steps, and create something that's "magic".
